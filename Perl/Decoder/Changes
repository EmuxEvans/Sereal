Revision history for Perl extension Sereal-Decoder

* Warning: For a seamless upgrade, upgrade to version 3
*          of the decoder before upgrading to version 3 of the
*          encoder!
4.000_001
  * New protocol, work in progress.
  * SRL_HDR_POS_VARINT replaces SRL_HDR_VARINT.
    SRL_HDR_POS_VARINT does not overlap with SRL_HDR_POS, which
    means that a canonical representation of positive integers
    is possible by forbidding SRL_HDR_VARINT.
    SRL_HDR_VARINT is still supported in the decoder in version 4,
    but considered non-canonical, and will not be produced by a v4
    encoder. (This also simplifies backward support.)
  * SRL_HDR_NEG_VARINT replaces SRL_HDR_ZIGZAG, producing a more
    compact representation of negative integers. It does not
    overlap SRL_HDR_NEG. SRL_HDR_ZIGZAG is still supported by
    the decoder but is considered non-canonical, will not be produced
    by a v4 encoder. (This also simplifies backward support.)
  * Various test suite changed required to support version 4.

3.003 Oct 19 2014
  * Niko Tyni fixed the 64-bit big endian Sereal bug! (Yay Niko!)
  * Sereal::Decoder::Constants will now have a defined $VERSION
  * Setup META.yml correctly so that certain dependencies are
    marked as being test dependencies and not build or run-time
    dependencies.
  * Allow one to build against an externally supplied version
    of csnappy or miniz. Thanks to Petr Písař <ppisar@redhat.com>

3.002 Aug 20 2014
  * Summary of changes from 3.001 - 3.002
  - Introduce "set_readonly" option to decoder
  - Introduce "set_readonly_scalars" option to decoder

  * Bug fixes
  - Fix assertion fails in DEBUG perls (Brian Fraser)
  - Fix segfault with "into" interface when decoding references and
    strings into the same target SV. See new test t/550_decode_into.t

  * Test Infra Changes
  - Split up bulk tests to speed up testing and make it easier
    to see when a failure is restricted to a specific option.

  * Big-Endian Support
  - Improved support for Big-Endian machines. We now build and pass test
    on Sparc and HP-UX and other platforms with big-endian or strict
    alignedness requirements. Much thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi,
    Gregor Herrmann, and H. Merijn Brand for for their assistance with
    this.
  - We still have issues with s390x (Z/Os) with Sereal. If someone wants
    to help it would be appreciated.

3.001
  - Upgrade to version 3 of the protocol
    * Add Zlib compression support to the protocol
    * Add Zlib support to Encoder/Decoder
    * Add CANONICAL_UNDEF tag to represent PL_sv_undef
    * Change magic header so it is trivial to detect
      and reject utf8 encoded Sereal packets.
  - Change how we serialize variables which have more
    than one of IOK, NOK, and POK set. In general we
    favour the numeric form, with the exception of when
    all three are set when we favour the string form
    (this is to handle engineering notation like "0E0"
    where numeric and string equivalence may differ)
